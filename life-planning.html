        <h2>Life Planning</h2>
        <p>
          Everyone has their own unique life goals and aspirations. Whether you
          want to start a successful startup, raise a happy family, achieve
          financial freedom at an early age, or pursue any other meaningful
          goal, it is essential to have a comprehensive plan in place.
        </p>
        <p>
          At GenZ Finance, we believe in the power of life planning to help you
          turn your dreams into reality. Life planning is a personalized
          approach that takes into account your current financial situation,
          future aspirations, and the stages you may encounter along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter how you spend your life, you will encounter "Surplus" and
          "Deficit" stages. During the "Surplus" stage, when you have the means,
          it is crucial to make the most of your resources and prepare for the
          future. The "Deficit" stage can occur when you are raising a child,
          supporting aging parents, starting a new business, or entering
          retirement. These are common deficit stages that individuals
          experience. Everyone will eventually reach a certain deficit stage,
          but the timing and circumstances can vary.
        </p>
        <p>

          create a tailored life plan that aligns with your specific needs,
